# Week9GameEngine

Added a dirty flag design pattern where health only shows when there is a numerical change (so when a player collides with another car) to lessen load on memory
Did not have time to fully implement object pooling, however if this game were to be fully developed I would implement object pooling whenever objects move out of the camera's view or raycast I would make it so those objects are deactivated to lessen the load on the memory
All in all this was an important lesson that let me learn when to implement these two design pattern to help with any game's optimization. I've also learned what I should focus on and improve on while studying for the final exam.
